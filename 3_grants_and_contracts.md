**3.1 Facilities and Administrative (F&amp;A) Costs Rate Policy for Research Awards and Sponsored Projects**

**Policy Statement**

**_~~It is the policy of CANR that all grants, contracts and other sponsored agreements accepted by University of Delaware are charged the maximum allowable federally negotiated Facilities and Administrative (F&amp;A) rate. This applies to direct awards and awards passed through other institutions or organizations under a sub-contract or consortium agreement.~~_**

**_~~Facilities and administrative costs, also known as indirect costs, are costs incurred by CANR in support of sponsored projects that cannot be charged directly to a specific grant, contract or other sponsored agreement. They represent expenses that have been incurred for common or joint objectives, and are necessary for the general operation of an organization and the activities it performs. CANR F&amp;A rates are established in accordance with the cost principles for universities (F&amp;A rates follow 2 CFR 200 (Uniform Guidance) guidelines.) These rates are negotiated between each UDEL and the Office of Naval Research.~~_**

**_~~F&amp;A rates are applicable to all externally sponsored projects funded by federal and non-federal sponsors, including industry sponsors. The application of these rates allows CANR to recover facilities costs and administrative costs associated with research activity. Facility costs consist of building depreciation, lease expense, maintenance, utilities, housekeeping, security, net costs of parking, transportation, Real Estate and Space Management, etc.~~_**

**_~~Administrative costs consist of Research Management: UDEL research administration, including Research Compliance; IACUC; PHS Research Management, including Grants &amp; Contracts; Research Finance; IRB; UDEL Research Office; UDEL Finance (including Accounting, Accounts Payable, Budgeting, Treasury, Analytics); Office of General Counsel; Materials Management/Purchasing; Information Systems; Central Services.~~_**

The on-campus rate includes both the facilities and administrative costs and the off-campus rate includes only the administrative portions (The Administrative portion is capped at 26% and UD’s off-campus rate is 28% so there is some facilities included in that rate). The full F&amp;A cost associated with research has historically exceeded the federally negotiated rate.

Without full-cost recovery, CANR is subsidizing the cost of the project for the sponsor.

UDEL negotiates a multi-year agreement of predetermined F&amp;A rates with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) every 3years. The current applicable rates are available on the UDEL research office website [**http://www.udel.edu/research/researchers/index.html**](http://www.udel.edu/research/researchers/index.html).

An exception from the policy of charging the negotiated F&amp;A rate will only be granted to awards from foundations, non-profit sponsors and government agencies, both federal and state, with explicit, published policies limiting their F&amp;A cost rate, provided such policies are applicable to all grant recipients, and only upon review and approval by the CANR associate dean for graduate programs and research. In conjunction, the terms and conditions of resulting awards must clearly delineate that ownership of results and of any or all intellectual property must rest with UDEL. If the sponsor insists on maintaining the rights to intellectual property, UDEL requires the sponsor to pay the federally negotiated onsite F&amp;A rate. 

For-profit sponsors are charged the negotiated F&amp;A rate unless the CANR associate dean for graduate programs and research has provided written approval of a rate less than the negotiated F&amp;A rate.

**Purpose of Policy**

This policy enables CANR to fulfill its financial obligations and comply with all grant, contract and research agreement terms and conditions. As a federal contractor, UDEL has a fiduciary responsibility to monitor the allocation of costs and obligations to all awards in a consistent manner, regardless of sponsor, in order to comply with federally mandated cost principles. Guidelines governing this policy include 2 CFR 200.414 and sponsor-specific policies and guidelines.

**Procedure**

**_F&amp;A Rate Components_**

The F&amp;A costs must be allowable, reasonable and allocable. These costs must be treated consistently across research programs as well as other federal programs.

**3.3 Sub-Recipient Monitoring Policy**

**3.3.1   Policy Statement**

UDEL is responsible for the programmatic, administrative and financial monitoring of all awards made to sub-recipients under federal and non-federal sponsored projects. UDEL has the obligation, throughout the life of the award, to monitor the activities of sub-recipients to make certain that project objectives are completed and all funds are used for authorized purposes in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and provisions of the prime contracts or grant agreements.

**3.3.2   Reason for Policy/Purpose**

A sub-recipient is a third-party organization performing a portion of a project awarded to a UDEL. The terms of the sub-recipient relationship are documented in a negotiated agreement (i.e., sub-award, sub-grant, sub-contract, or consortium agreement), and signed by authorized representatives of each organization. This policy and its related procedure set forth the requirements necessary for the preparation and issuance of a sub-award under a prime contract or grant and for monitoring the sub-recipient activity. It does not apply to consulting agreements or goods and services. Further, this policy is applicable to all federal and non-federal projects and is consistent with 2 CFR 200.331 Uniform Guidance

**3.3.3   Preamble Memorandum**

CANR shall apply the provisions of the sections of this policy to entities, whether they are recipients, expending Federal awards received directly from Federal awarding agencies, or are sub-recipients expending Federal awards received from a pass-through entity (a recipient or another sub-recipient).

**3.3.4 Roles and Responsibilities**

Principal Investigators have sub-recipient monitoring responsibilities that include:

*   Confirm the budget and scope of the project.
    *   Monitor the activities of sub-recipients to determine that funds are used for    authorized purposes and that performance of obligations defined in the sub-award or consortium agreement is being accomplished, including timely submission of deliverables.
*   Review and approve invoices from sub-recipients and question expenditures, if necessary.
*   Work with the research office and confirm that sub-recipient has taken timely and appropriate scientific action
*   Notify the research office if they become aware of scientific or financial non-compliance by any sub-recipients
*   Assist the research office with increased scrutiny of sub-recipient activities if warranted by an audit finding department administration has sub-recipient monitoring responsibilities that include frequent, in-depth, and documented communication with the sub-recipient concerning scientific and financial activities. The PI, department administrator, and the research office will determine a schedule and plan for this increased scrutiny and communication.
*   Monitor the activities of sub-recipients to ensure funds supporting the sub-award that are used for authorized purposes, including progress of performance obligations defined in the sub-award or consortium agreement and submission of invoices and administrative deliverables and question expenditures that do not match the budget.

**3.3.5   Procedures for Pre-Award and Subcontract Development**

**_~~The research office and the PI/Department will work together to identify and review technical qualifications for sub-recipients during proposal development. These activities will help identify the appropriate Statement of Work (SOW), and the budgetary, regulatory and compliance related requirements associated with the agreement. They include the following:~~_**

*   The PI will identify qualified sub-recipients during proposal development and request a formal proposal from sub-recipient for the relevant SOW activities. The proposal will include the technical, budgetary and administrative information necessary for compliance with sponsor and partner requirements and are incorporated into the prime proposal submission package.
*   Approvals by the sub-recipients authorized institutional representatives for compliance, budgetary and regulatory issues must be included in the proposal.
*   The research office will review the sub-recipient information during the proposal review process and notify the PI/department in the event additional information is required.
*   PIs are expected to submit the following documents seven working days in advance of a proposal submission deadline: abstract or summary of the project; budget; justification; the request for applications or proposals document provided by the sponsor. Additionally, as per sponsor requirements a biographical sketch or CV and a current and pending support document should be submitted for each investigator involved in the project.
*   These documents should be submitted to the PI’s departmental business officer. Subsequently, the business officer will initiate the proposal webform and the approval routing process for the proposal.
*   The seven day advance submission provides sufficient time for budgetary and compliance review by the CANR research office.
*   Three days in advance of the proposal submission deadline all grant materials should be available for review by the CANR and UD research offices. Failure to observe these advance deadlines risks missing the proposal due date.

**3.3.6   Progress Monitoring, Technical Reports, and Deliverables**

CANR is required to monitor the progress of sub-recipients working on its projects.  Specifically, the PI is responsible for monitoring the technical activities of the project, and, with research office, will oversee the administrative and financial activities of the sub-recipient. This is accomplished using a variety of means:

*   The frequent review and evaluation (i.e., phone conversations, email communication, face-to-face discussion, on-going dialogue) of sub-recipient activities and deliverables to make periodic determinations about the sub-recipient’s overall progress and ensure that the goals of the project are being met.
*   Sub-recipient technical and financial reports are collected, reviewed, and evaluated in a timely manner by the PI/department and Research Office, as appropriate.
*   Unusual or unforeseen items outlined in or omitted from the financial and technical reports should be investigated and addressed by the PI.
*   All sub-recipient technical and administrative reports should be retained on file and readily accessible for institutional, sponsor, and federal auditors and regulators.

**3.3.7   Invoices**

**_~~Sub-recipient invoices are reviewed by the research office, PI, and department for appropriateness and thoroughness to ensure that they contain a minimum level of information, including but not limited to:~~_**

*   Name of sub-recipient
*   Date of invoice
*   Invoice number
*   Period of performance covered by invoice
*   Description of goods and services reflected by billings
*   Current period costs (with sufficient detail)
*   Cumulative project costs as compared to the expense budget
*   Sub-recipient contact person with respect to the invoice
*   Statement that the funds expended are reasonable, allowable, and allocable
*   Statement that the costs are in compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement

**_~~If, after review of the invoice, an issue or concern with the sub-recipient is identified, the PI and research office are responsible for working with the sub-recipient to resolve that issue or concern. As part of this attempt, PI’s/departmental administrators should request clarification of any unusual, miscellaneous, excessive or potentially unallowable charges invoiced by the sub-recipient. If the explanations are insufficient to render a reasonable judgment on the allowable cost, the department will contact the research office, who will then request detailed justifications and support from sub-recipients. Examples of detailed justifications and support may include but are not limited to payroll data and copies of paid invoices showing the cost of items purchased and vendor justification forms if required by sponsor.~~_**

In the event that additional financial or administrative support is required, the research office will assist the PI as needed. Invoices should not be paid until all issues or concerns have been addressed, as the research office will not process charges determined to be unreasonable, unallowable or not allocable.
