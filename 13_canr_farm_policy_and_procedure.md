**13.3 Animal Use**

**Animal Care and Use**: In 2015, the Agricultural Animal Care and Use Committee (AACUC) was dissolved at the request of the VP for Research, and additional members were added to the University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) to handle agricultural animal use. This is the norm nationwide. Policies governing the care and use of animals in teaching, research and extension are found: [**https://www1.udel.edu/research/preparing/animalcare.html**](https://www1.udel.edu/research/preparing/animalcare.html)

**13.4 Equipment Use**

Equipment and items found within the four units of the Farm are controlled by the unit’s manager. Permission to use these items should be secured through the unit’s manager and returned in a timely fashion.
