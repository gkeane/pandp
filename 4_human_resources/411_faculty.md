**4.1.1.1\. Faculty Hiring**

All faculty hiring must be approved by the dean of the college, and all positions requested must be newly justified and relate to the UD, college and departmental strategic plans. A vacancy left by retirement or departure of a faculty member from a given department does not justify filling a position. Faculty will be hired on 9-month (academic year) contracts that begin on September 1 unless extenuating circumstances necessitate deviations from this policy. Salary, benefits and allocated costs for all faculty reside in the college’s central budget unless separately negotiated or funded by endowments or gifts.

**4.1.1.2 Faculty Startup Costs**

**_~~Startup costs are typically split evenly between departmental and central college budgets unless negotiated otherwise between the dean and department chair. Startup allocations are typically spread over the first three years of the faculty member’s appointment and must be spent no later than the end of the fifth year of appointment. Unused startup funds will be returned to their sources at the end of the fifth year of appointment, or when the faculty member leaves the College, whichever comes first.~~_**

**4.1.1.3** **Fiscal to Academic Contract Conversion Policy for Faculty**

From the 1990s until July 1, 2014, a policy had been in place that allowed faculty to convert from a fiscal year (11-month) to an academic year (9-month) contract with _no loss of salary_. Those converting were not eligible for salary increases for the two years following conversion. On July 1, 2014, this policy was voided and replaced with the standing University policy where salary would be reduced by 2/11’s upon conversion from fiscal to academic year contract.

4.1.1.4\. Faculty departure from the College

Regardless of the reason for departure, upon ending employment with the College faculty members shall:

*   Return all keys and university property according to UD Guidelines (is there a faculty handbook section on this?)
*   Remove personal belongings from office, lab, storage and other university spaces
*   Consult with the unit leader for CANR IT regarding the transfer, deletion, and handling of data and digital media (cite the policy??) and computers or other IT devices used for work.

Any unused balances in accounts assigned to faculty will be returned to their original source or to the sponsor in the case of sponsored program accounts.
