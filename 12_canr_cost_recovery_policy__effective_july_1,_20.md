# **12\. CANR Cost Recovery Policy (Effective July 1, 2014)** {#12-canr-cost-recovery-policy-effective-july-1-2014}

**_~~12.1\. Purpose~~_**

**_~~The College of Agriculture and Natural Resources seeks to recover costs related to research and extension for assets that are not factored into Facilities and Administrative Costs (F&amp;A, or indirect costs) of sponsored research projects. Asset use for teaching is covered by tuition and fees payments of our students.~~_**

**_~~12.2 Process~~_**

**_~~The policy will be coordinated by the CANR Deputy Dean and the CANR Cost Recovery Committee. Recommendations will be made through the CANR Cost Recovery Committee to the dean for new fees and changes to existing fees. Business and grants staff in the CANR dean’s office will oversee matters of logistics related to policy implementation, working in conjunction with departmental business staff.~~_**

**_~~12.3 Fee Determination~~_**

**_~~Any proposed fees must be constructed from actual cost data in a rigorous fashion so as to withstand an audit. Fees cannot be set by adopting rates included in fee schedules at other universities for similar assets. However, benchmarking of CANR fees against those of our peers, and consultation with our peers may be useful in the development and justification of cost recovery fees.~~_**
