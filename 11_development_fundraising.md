# **11\. Development/Fundraising** {#11-development-fundraising}

The University’s Office of Development and Alumni Relations engages donors, alumni, friends, parents, faculty, staff, students, corporations, foundations and organizations in a lifelong relationship, and fosters a tradition of philanthropy to strengthen the University’s legacy as one of the great public institutions of higher education in America.

Members of the CANR community are encouraged to partner in alumni and donor interactions. CANR’s Director of Development is responsible for coordinating all development activity on behalf of the College, it departments, programs and centers. Any faculty, staff or volunteers should work through CANR’s Director of Development to ensure proper coordination. This includes requests for alumni mailing lists, honor rolls, etc. Detailed information regarding donor management practices can be found in the Office of Development and Alumni Relations’ Prospect Management policies and procedures manual. These policies define the roles and responsibilities for gift officers and operations staff for managing relationships with, and information about, our many alumni, friends, staff, parents, students and other supporters.

**11.1\. Donor Contact**

The University of Delaware (UD) is grateful for the financial support it receives from its donors and understands the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information.  The University takes donors’ right to privacy very seriously and recognizes that, to merit donors&#039; continued trust, it is important to be transparent and accountable in preserving the confidentiality of the personal information that UD collects and maintains. For the purpose of communicating individually or collectively with CANR alumni and donors, CANR’s Director of Development will serve as a liaison for all alumni and donor information requests. He or she will also serve as a liaison between donors and the College to ensure confidentiality and appropriate communication. Personal information of a donor should never be shared with another party without the owner’s permission. This includes addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and grade-related information.  

**11.2\. Gift Funds and Donor Intent**

All gifts must be directed to a specific gift fund and recorded as such in the Development and Alumni Relations database. The choice of fund will be consistent with the written directions from the donor. All gifts requiring the creation of a _new_ endowed or named fund must be documented in writing from the donor, using a gift commitment document (retrieved from CANR’s Development Director). The Vice President or Associate Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations must approve all new endowed or named funds.
