**7.1\. CANR Space Utilization Policy**

**7.1.1 Purpose of Policy**

This policy provides the framework for utilization, stewardship, and conservation of all CANR space resources, including buildings, physical assets, farmland, and natural areas. It also establishes the basis for a regular review process of the College’s space needs and the use of its physical assets. Finally, this policy provides the procedures and guidelines for the assignment of space and relocation of faculty and staff. The College will allocate and reassign space to best support and further the College’s mission and priorities, as outlined in the current College strategic plan.

**7.1.2\. Space Ownership and Shared Governance**

**_~~All CANR Space is (re)assigned by the Dean or a designee of the Dean. The Dean considers recommendations from the CANR Space Utilization Committee in the (re)assignment of space. The CANR Space Utilization Committee consists of a representative from each CANR Department, the Carvel Research and Education Center, and Cooperative Extension, and functions in accordance with the College bylaws. The CANR Deputy Dean heads and convenes the committee, and seeks the recommendation of CANR unit leadership to select individual committee members. The CANR Facilities Manager serves as an ex-officio, non-voting committee member and functions in an essential advisory role to the committee.~~_**

**7.1.3\. Guidelines for Assignment of Space**

*   **_~~Space can be assigned only to individuals or groups who are current members of the College, including faculty, staff, or students of the College, or emeriti faculty. Official CANR visitors and other external parties may be assigned temporary space upon the recommendation of the CANR Space Utilization Committee and/or at the discretion of the Dean.~~_**
*   **_~~All vacated space in CANR is returned to the college’s unassigned space inventory immediately after it is vacated by the assignee. Assignee contents in vacated space must be removed within 60 days.~~_**
*   **_~~All requests for additional space or reassignment of existing space shall be submitted by unit leaders (e.g., department chairs, county extension directors) based on appropriate discussions with faculty and staff in their units.~~_**
*   **_~~Space constructed with either internal or external funds is part of the College space inventory and is (re)assigned consistent with priorities outlined in the current CANR strategic plan. Participation in fundraising does not automatically grant the perpetual right or exclusive use of space built with such funds.~~_**
*   **_~~The CANR Deputy Dean will review all space change requests and share these with the Space Utilization Committee. Together, the Deputy Dean and Committee will determine whether a meeting and vote need to be arranged, or if the Deputy Dean can simply make a recommendation on their own, depending on the scope and nature of the request. Generally, changes to the function of a space, competing requests for a space, or a change in unit assignment will require full involvement of the Committee. Recommendations of the Space Utilization Committee are sent to the Dean who is responsible for ultimate decisions on the assignment of space.~~_**
*   **_~~Office Assignments:~~_**

**_~~The following general guidelines are used to assign space for faculty and staff offices and workrooms. University policies regarding the size and quality of office space will apply to the College of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources.~~_**

*   **_~~Members of the same unit or working group will ideally be located in close proximity to promote their effective functioning and to facilitate communication within those groups.~~_**
*   **_~~Faculty offices are assigned in the following order: full-time faculty, part-time faculty or S-contract lecturers, visiting scientists, and adjunct or affiliate faculty. Faculty should not have more than one office, unless approved by the Dean. To the extent possible, faculty shall have their own office; however, CANR adjunct faculty, S-contract lecturers, and visiting scientists may be housed in shared offices with at least one other person.~~_**
*   **_~~Emeriti faculty do not retain offices, but may be assigned an office when employed as teachers in a given semester or year.~~_**
*   **_~~Extension professional offices at county locations and the Carvel Center are assigned by the respective unit leader.~~_**
*   **_~~Administrative Offices: Staff offices may be private, shared, or open landscape, as appropriate. Staff should not have more than one office.~~_**
*   **_~~Laboratory Assignments:~~_**

**_~~For laboratory space assigned to a unit, the unit leader (Chair or Director) will make assignments within the unit consistent with the shared use philosophy for flexible laboratory spaces as outlined in the college strategic plan. Vacated laboratory spaces for any unit are placed on the unassigned space inventory when the assignee vacates the lab.~~_**

*   **_~~Classroom Assignments:~~_**

**_~~The CANR Facilities Manager is responsible for assigning all classroom space managed directly by CANR and for working with the UD scheduling office to assign those classrooms scheduled centrally. Classrooms are assigned in accordance with the CANR Classroom Utilization Policy (see Appendix A).~~_**

*   **_~~Land and Specialized Farm Structure Assignments:~~_**

**_~~The superintendents of the Newark and Thurman Adams Farms will oversee land assignments for college activities, and consult with the Carvel Center Director or CANR Deputy Dean to resolve competing requests. Requests for repurposing farmland or changing its function from current usage may be reviewed by the committee if adjacent areas are impacted.~~_**

*   **_~~Greenhouse and Growth Chamber Assignments:~~_**

**__**

**_~~The Fischer Greenhouse Complex Manager or their designee will oversee greenhouse and growth chamber assignments, and consult with the Carvel Center Director or CANR Deputy Dean to resolve competing requests.~~_**

*   **_~~Storage Assignments:~~_**

**_~~Spaces designated for storage are common college property to which all details of this policy apply. Conversion of office, lab, classroom or other types of space to storage is discouraged and must be reviewed by the Committee and approved by the Dean. Storage space assignments within storage areas designated to a unit for their use are made by the unit leader.~~_**

*   **_~~Common Space Assignments:~~_**

**_~~Scheduling of common use spaces such as the Townsend Commons or conference rooms is done by the dean’s administrative assistant or his/her designee. Only competing requests are forwarded to the Committee. Conference rooms and other common spaces at county Extension offices and the Carvel Center are scheduled by the respective unit leader or their designee.~~_**

**7.1.4\. Procedure for Space Requests and Space Assignment in CANR**

*   **_~~The CANR Facilities Manager will have primary responsibility for maintaining an up-to-date CANR space inventory (http://canr.udel.edu/about-us/staff-resources/canr-space-committee/), which will list all currently available space and any space expected to become available in the near future. The CANR Facilities Manager will also update the CANR Space Utilization Committee and all unit leaders on current and expected available space regularly.~~_**
*   **_~~A CANR Space Request is the only method by which a unit may change its assigned space inventory. All requests must have the signature of the unit leader. Individuals or groups may request the use of vacant space by discussing this with their unit leader who will review and approve all requests prior to submitting a space request from electronically to spacerequest@anr.edu. Requests for space reassignment are posted on the College web site immediately and all unit leaders are notified via email of the request by the CANR Facilities Manager. Any competing requests for the space must be submitted to the CANR Space Utilization Committee within 30 days of notification of unit leaders of the space request.~~_**
*   **_~~The CANR Space Utilization committee will base decisions primarily upon alignment of the space request with the mission and priorities in the current CANR strategic plan. To assist the Committee in their decisions, space requests should also include information regarding the relationship of requested space to current and future program needs, existence of funding, the need for renovation (and the expected magnitude), and impact of reallocation of space from one CANR unit to another.~~_**
*   **_~~The requesting unit(s) will receive the following feedback during the space request process: (i) confirmation that the request is complete and provides enough information to proceed; (ii) the need to clarify issues or meet with the Committee related to space requests; and (iii) the Committee’s recommendation to the Dean.~~_**
*   **_~~The Committee will make a recommendation on all space requests to the Dean within one month after meeting to discuss the request, under most circumstances. Committee decisions are finalized by a basic majority vote. At least three Committee members must vote to finalize a decision. Space committee meetings will be at approximately two-month intervals.~~_**
*   **_~~If two or more requests are made for the same space, the Dean will review competing requests with the CANR Space Utilization Committee and may consult additional sources for input, such as university architects, UD Academic Technology, other deans, etc., before rendering a decision.~~_**
*   **_~~The Dean will make the final decision about all CANR space use requests and notify all unit leaders involved in the space request of her/his decision.~~_**

**7.1.5\. CANR Space Survey and Long-term Space Planning**

**_~~Each CANR unit is required to conduct an annual inventory of the space currently assigned to it and the use of that space. The CANR Facilities Manager will initiate this process annually on February 1st, requesting all units to submit their space inventory update, along with anticipated future changes by March 1st. If improvements in space use seem possible by relocation, consolidation, or physical changes, the alternatives are explored with the affected units and reviewed with the CANR Space Utilization Committee. Upon completion of the annual space survey, the CANR Facilities Manager will forward to the CANR Space Utilization Committee and the Dean a list of space that is underutilized or is available for reassignment as well as any future space needs identified by departments.~~_**

**7.1.6\. Appendix A: CANR Classroom Assignment Policy**

*   **_~~Classroom space is assigned both by CANR (TNS 006, 007, 012; WOR 103, 105,114, 124, 202, 203,205; FGL 102 and 103; Newton Building Classroom; and Webb Farm teaching spaces) and centrally by the UD Course Scheduling Office (TNS 002,009, and 132).~~_**
*   **_~~The CANR Facilities Manager , or her/his designee, is responsible for assigning all classroom space managed directly by CANR and for working with the UD scheduling office to assign classrooms scheduled centrally.~~_**
*   **_~~Classrooms are allocated and scheduled to optimize space utilization and meet academic needs of students and instructors.~~_**
*   **_~~Classroom utilization is reviewed annually by the CANR Facilities Manager , in consultation with unit leaders, to identify trends in teaching/learning to be proactive in meeting future needs, and to identify underutilized rooms that could be relinquished for other uses.~~_**
*   **_~~Requests for all CANR classroom space are submitted by departmental course scheduling coordinators to the CANR Facilities Manager by appropriate deadlines. Late requests will not be considered.~~_**

**_Guidelines for Making Classroom Requests for CANR Teaching Facilities_**

*   *   *   **_~~Classrooms are assigned first to those with academic reasons for space in CANR facilities. Academic reasons must be clearly explained on the classroom request form. First preference will go to courses requiring space for teaching laboratories. These include courses that use equipment or facilities that can be accommodated only in a particular laboratory or field site.~~_**
        *   **_~~A history of teaching in a classroom or laboratory and/or faculty seniority does not guarantee assignment to a particular classroom.~~_**
        *   **_~~The CANR Associate Dean for Graduate Programs, or her/his designee, will make final decisions on all classroom assignments after reviewing all requests.~~_**
*   **_~~Requests are granted on a space-available basis, with those having academic-related needs being filled first. Other requests are considered as space allows, based on factors such as size and type of class, dates/times of class meetings, and the need for faculty or graduate students to be in proximity to their research laboratories.~~_**
*   **_~~All courses taught in CANR facilities between 8am and 6pm must be taught in accordance with the standard University schedule.~~_**
*   **_~~Alternate classroom requests can be made, and other options are explored and provided to the faculty member prior to final assignment of classroom space.~~_**
*   **_~~The UD Scheduling Office controls the scheduling of classrooms 002, 009, and 132 TNS and makes the final determination on courses taught in these rooms. In some cases, non-CANR courses may be scheduled in these rooms before CANR courses.~~_**

**7.2\. Property inventory**

The CANR property inventory is conducted annually and maintained by the CANR Facilities Manager.
