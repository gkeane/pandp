**14.1\. Definition**

Self-supporting units are fee collecting, not-for-profit units of the college that offer products and services related to the teaching, research and extension missions of the college. They are designed to be self-supporting through collection of fees (hence the name), though various sources of subsidy may be applied to their budgets and some _pro bono_ products and services may be offered to internal and external stakeholders.
