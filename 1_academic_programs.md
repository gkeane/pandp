**1.1.3\. CANR Graduate Tuition Policy (Effective July 1, 2014)**

**_~~1.1.3.1 Requirement for partial tuition paid from sources other than Tuition Waiver Authority~~_**

The College of Agriculture and Natural Resources requires that a minimum **15% of graduate tuition** to be paid from sources other than the Tuition Waiver Authority of the College. As with any college policy, exemptions in rare cases may be granted by the dean if extenuating circumstances warrant. The following points clarify the policy:

*   **_~~This policy goes into effect for students enrolled in CANR graduate programs after January 1, 2015 who receive tuition assistance from the College’s Tuition Waiver Authority. This includes full- and part-time students, those on assistantship contract and those not on contracts but receiving partial stipend and/or tuition support. Students on Sustaining Status are full-time students. Students in intercollegiate programs but mentored and funded by a CANR faculty member are subject to this policy.~~_**

**_~~Important: Students on annual contract beginning fall semester 2014 will not be impacted until fall semester 2015 since their contracts carry through spring semester 2015.~~_**

**_~~In addition, students paid from grants awarded prior to July 1, 2014 are grandfathered, receiving 100% of tuition from the College’s Tuition Waiver Authority until they finish their program or the grant expires, whichever comes first.~~_**

*   **_~~When tuition policies in different UD colleges are in conflict on intercollegiate grants, the deans of the colleges involved (or their designees) will decide on a course of action that accommodates the parties involved.~~_**
*   **_~~Specific tuition arrangements in cooperative agreements or memoranda of understanding between UD and other entities shall supersede this policy for students that enroll under such agreements.~~_**
*   **_~~Fulbright Scholars are exempted from the policy as they add diversity and prestige to CANR graduate programs; they will receive 100% tuition waivers for the length of their Fulbright scholarship.~~_**
*   **_~~To honor historic commitments of providing departments with TA support, up to three exemptions to the policy are honored per department, i.e., 100% of the tuition for up to three designated TAs is paid from the College’s Tuition Waiver Authority.~~_**
*   **_~~Programs enrolling self-funded students or those whose tuition is paid by non-grant funds external to the university (e.g., national fellowships, gift agreements, foreign government support) are eligible for up to a 50% remission of tuition paid for the anticipated term of the student’s program.~~_**
*   **_~~At the beginning of each fiscal year, (commencing with FY16) as departmental budgets are distributed, College Tuition Waiver Authority is allocated to departments for 85% of the anticipated tuition billed to students qualifying under this policy. Departments assume responsibility for 15% of the total tuition billed for qualifying students.~~_**
*   **_~~This policy is agnostic to the source of stipend funds and includes cases where stipends are derived from federal capacity funds (e.g., Hatch, Smith-Lever, McIntire-Stennis, and Animal Health), University funds, and other sources allocated by the dean.~~_**
*   **_~~By law, federal capacity funds or their state match cannot be used to pay the department’s 15% of tuition billed. Normally, non-matching state funds, grants, gifts, and University base budget funds can be used for payment of tuition unless prohibited by specific language in the appropriation.~~_**
*   **_~~The policy is coordinated by the CANR Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Programs. Business and grants staff in the CANR dean’s office will oversee matters of logistics related to policy implementation, working in conjunction with departmental graduate coordinators and business staff.~~_**

**1.1.3.2 Requirement to utilize Sustaining Status for students who qualify**

*   **_~~UD’s Sustaining Status must be used for all students who qualify (~~_**[**_~~Graduate and Professional Education Policies &amp; Procedures~~_**](http://www.udel.edu/gradoffice/polproc/registration.html)**_~~), effective January 1, 2015\.~~_**
*   **_~~Students on Sustaining Status and on contract may continue to receive a stipend and maintain student health care, student loan deferral, visa status (if foreign), and all other benefits provided to full-time students; they are considered “full-time”. Students must receive financial assistance of at least 50% of the minimum stipend to remain on contract while registered as Sustaining.~~_**

**1.1.3.3 Cap on number of credits eligible for partial or full waiver**

*   **_~~CANR will not waive any portion of tuition for credits beyond the minimum required for the degree, effective January 1, 2015\. Students should register in Sustaining Status once the amount of credit and course requirements for the degree have been met. Extenuating circumstances may be considered in cases with unusual research, teaching or outreach requirements that cause extensions in the program of study beyond the student’s control.~~_**
*   **_~~Sustaining fees are treated the same as tuition in RBB and in the CANR Graduate Tuition Policy. Thus, the college will pay 85% of the sustaining fee for each semester that the student is anticipated to remain in Sustaining Status. The remaining 15% must be paid from sources other than the College’s Tuition Waiver Authority.~~_**

**1.1.3.4 Incentive structure for graduate tuition on grants**

*   **_~~The former ad hoc policy of returning 70% of the graduate tuition included on a grant to the principal investigator is voided as of midnight, February 28 2015\.~~_**
