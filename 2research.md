**2.1\. Eligibility as Principal Investigator**

**PURPOSE**

**_~~For each sponsored award, it is customary to designate a Principal Investigator (PI) who is directly responsible and accountable to the University of Delaware (UDEL) and sponsor for the proper programmatic, scientific or technical conduct of the project, and its financial and day-to-day management. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the eligibility requirements as well as the general duties and responsibilities of the Principal Investigator named in an application for all sponsored project funding and the resulting sponsored project, grant, cooperative agreement, contract, subcontract or other award mechanism received by CANR.~~_**

**_~~POLICY STATEMENT~~_**

*   **_~~Eligibility to serve as a Principal Investigator (PI), Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI), Multiple Principal Investigator (Multi-PI) or Project Director of a research award is a privilege limited to individuals:~~_**
    *   *   *   **_~~With a current UDEL, CANR appointment who are principally paid by UDEL~~_**

*   *   *   *   **_~~Who hold a faculty appointment- within UDEL~~_**
*   **_~~PI eligibility is limited to individuals who hold a minimum academic rank of Instructor, or Extension Specialist at CANR or are in the process of obtaining such an appointment at the time of the grant application.~~_**
*   **_~~Eligibility and continued service as PI are contingent upon compliance with all applicable CANR or UDEL policies, as well as all federal, state and local government policies and regulations and the terms and conditions of the award.~~_**
*   **_~~The responsibilities that accompany Principal Investigator status may not be delegated explicitly or implicitly to individuals who do not qualify to serve as Principal Investigator or Project Director. Under the terms and conditions of most sponsored project awards, a change of PI is subject to the prior written approval of the awarding agency or sponsor.~~_**
*   **_~~PI eligibility and status may be revoked by the CANR Dean in the event of failure to:~~_**
*   **_~~Comply with the provisions of this policy~~_**
*   **_~~Comply with the CANR and UDEL policies and procedures~~_**
*   **_~~Comply with all applicable federal, state and local government policies and regulations~~_**
*   **_~~Comply with the terms and conditions of the award for which the individual has been named PI~~_**
*   **_~~Monitor all grant accounts regularly, demonstrating fiscal responsibility for all projects; or~~_**
*   **_~~Maintain all sponsored project accounts in good financial standing. A pattern of accounts in deficit status that cannot be readily resolved through transfer of the overrun to an unrestricted account may result in withdrawal of the privilege to serve as Principal Investigator.~~_**

**EXCEPTIONS**

**_~~Exceptions to this policy may be granted upon written request and approval by the department chair (or institutional official who has oversight responsibility for the proposed PI and for the appropriate/compliant stewardship of resulting award/account) and approval of the associate dean for research at the CANR. The application and procedure to apply for PI status under special circumstances exception is included as Attachment A of this policy.~~_**

**_~~Other professionals may serve as Principal Investigator when the sponsored project activities are within the scope of the individual’s licensure, appointment and training, and the department chair has signified their approval by approving the UDEL Proposal Approval Webform (PAF) via electronic signature and completion of the approval routing process in PeopleSoft at the application stage.~~_**

**_~~Certain funding programs (e.g., Individual National Research Service Awards and NIH Career Development Awards) are tailored to post-doctoral fellows/research associates who, by convention, would be named “Principal Investigator” upon receipt of the fellowship. It is understood that graduate students, post-doctoral research fellows, and other individuals who are approved to serve as a PI do so under the supervision of a responsible faculty member or mentor. The mentor has responsibility for the performance of the grant, supervision and fiscal accountability and award oversight.~~_**

Department chair approval is signified via approval on the Webform.

**RESOURCES/SPACE**

Special attention should be given to the issue of resources necessary for successful execution of the project. Department Chair approval, certified on the Webform and cover sheet, signifies an intended commitment on the part of the administering department to provide the laboratory and/or office space required by the project, as well as a statement of ability on the part of the administering department or division to dedicate the personnel named on the application/grant for the level of effort specified in the resulting award. The use of CANR space and resources is at the discretion of the Dean, Department Chair, and/or Associate Dean for Research. Assignment of space is outlined in section 7.1.3 **Guidelines for Assignment of Space**. Continued use of space and resources is dependent upon availability and the PI’s ability to maintain eligibility to serve as a PI under the provisions of this policy and on the condition of continued employment.

**2.1.2 Limitation of Authority**

**_~~Designation as PI, Co-PI, Multi-PI, or PD per se does not confer institutional signature authority. No such individual may sign for the institution or convey institutional concurrence to any:~~_**

**__**

*   **_~~Proposal/application~~_**
*   **_~~Award (including but not limited to grants, contracts, subcontracts, fellowships, cooperative agreements and subcontracts)~~_**
*   **_~~Material Transfer Agreements~~_**
*   **_~~Non-Disclosure Agreements~~_**
*   **_~~Restricted Access Data Use Agreements~~_**
*   **_~~Institutional Service Agreements or any other agreement/contract on behalf of a partner institution~~_**

**_~~Only institutional officials with board-designated signature authority or designated specific individuals in the research office may sign for or commit the institution.~~_**

This policy pertains only to eligibility to apply for sponsored project funding (for internal and external funding programs) and be named as the Principal Investigator in any/all resulting awards.

**DEFINITIONS**

**_Principal Investigator_** - the principal Investigator is an individual who is or becomes eligible under this policy to submit a proposal for intramural or extramural support for a research, training, or public service project. This individual will personally participate in the design, conduct and reporting of the project and will have primary responsibility for the scientific, technical, administrative and financial aspects of the project.

**_Co-Principal Investigator_** - the co-principal Investigator is an investigator who will share responsibility for the scientific, technical, administrative and financial aspects of the project with the principal investigator. Each individual named as a co-principal investigator at CANR must meet the same eligibility requirements as the principal investigator. The principal investigator may name more than one co-principal Investigator on a project.

**_Multiple Principal Investigators_** - multiple principal investigators is a term used when more than one principal investigator is named in an application or resulting award and each is expected to equally share responsibility for leadership of multidisciplinary and other team science projects that are not best served by the single principal investigator model. When multiple principal investigators are named, they share the major authority and responsibility for leading and directing the project, intellectually and logistically. Each PI named is equally accountable for the proper conduct of the project including required tangible deliverables, fiscal oversight, sub-recipient monitoring and submission of all required reports. All PIs named in the application will discuss and designate a primary point of contact who will serve as the liaison between the sponsor and the rest of the leadership team while still recognizing that all PI’s are equally responsible for their projects. The presence of more than one identified PI on an application or award diminishes neither the responsibility nor the accountability of any individual PI. Multiple principal investigators must meet the same eligibility requirements as the principal investigator.

**_Project Director_** - Project Director is a term that may be used by sponsors of training or public service projects. For the purposes of this policy, the project director is defined as the principal investigator and shall assume the same responsibilities upon acceptance of this role.

**PI RESPONSIBILITIES/PROCESS**

**_~~The process described below is applicable to CANR whose sponsored research activities are supported by UDEL shall develop a process that mirrors the UDEL research administration office. This process is applicable for ALL externally supported research, extension, public service, instructional activities, where the external support is $1,000 or more.~~_**

**2.1.3 Application Stage**

**2.1.4 Award Stage**

*   **_~~The research office will notify the PI and grant administrator that an award has been made. Reconfirm with all staff who are paid by the new award that the level of effort stated in the award are available for the time-period of the award and that their financial interests have not changed since the application was submitted and if there has been a change, submit a request, via the research office, to the sponsor for approval of the change of effort.~~_**
*   **_~~The research office will:~~_**
*   **_~~Notify all subcontractors that an award has been made and reconfirm their intent, willingness and ability to be engaged in the project~~_**
*   **_~~When the award has been activated and the purpose code number received, review the award budget and work with department administrator to have Labor Allocation Modules (LAM) data changes submitted to add staff to the new purpose code and order start-up supplies as needed and approved in the award budget.~~_**

**__**

*   **_~~Through the life of the award or project period, maintain all sponsored project purpose codes in good financial standing~~_**
*   **_~~Using UDataGlance, monitor the expenses posted to each award on a monthly basis to ensure that each cost is allowable (per the cost principles, and the terms and conditions of the award), allocable and reasonable.~~_****__**
*   **_~~Work with the department’s grants administrator to initiate cost transfers in accordance with the University of Delaware cost transfer policy when costs are identified to have posted to an account in error, and use the UDataGlance to confirm transfers were done correctly the following month as well as to monitor the new expenses that have been incurred and posted.~~_**
*   **_~~Monitor the activities at each subcontractor site to ensure that the work is being done on time and in accordance with the agreed upon scope of work.~~_**

*   **_~~Ensure that all deliverables both reporting and tangible (i.e.; model organisms, cell lines, restricted access data sets) are submitted to the sponsor in accordance with the terms and conditions of award.~~_**
*   **_~~Ensure that any/all compliance committee approvals are maintained throughout the life of the award.~~_**
*   **_~~Ensure that any changes made during the active project period that require the prior written approval of the sponsor follow the applicable approval process (such as reducing level of effort of key personnel by 25% or more).~~_**
*   **_~~Ensure that data changes are done in accordance with the approved award budget and in a timely manner to remove or add staff to the project as needed.~~_**
*   **_~~Ensure that requisitions are via Webform in a timely manner and with sufficient justification to gain approval and avoid interruptions in the flow of the scope of work.~~_**
*   **_~~Ensure that the project does not go into overdraft as this will result in a deficit that will require resolution from the PI’s unrestricted account. Overdraft spending is prohibited and patterns of accelerated spending identified through monthly account monitoring activities must be addressed and rectified expeditiously. Failure to monitor and maintain each account in good standing may result in the rescinding of PI eligibility.~~_**
*   **_~~In the event of a change of PI, please consult your post award grant administrator in the research office for guidance as to how to proceed with making a request for a change of PI.~~_**
*   **_~~Any time there is an exception made to this policy, a copy of the request for exception and corresponding approval from the department chair and CANR dean must be uploaded in the official project record maintained in PeopleSoft.~~_**
