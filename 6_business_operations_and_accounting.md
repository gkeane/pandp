**6.1\. Budget process, transparency and reporting**

The dean of the college has the responsibility to create and disseminate annually a college-level budget, showing all main sources of revenue and expense, the latter including aggregate allocations to all major units of the college. In the interest of transparency, the college-level budget is available to stakeholders, internal and external, upon request.

Each year, all unit leaders submit a unit-level budget request to the dean for the upcoming fiscal year; normally, submissions will occur in May-June. Justification is required for changes in unit-level budgets.

The dean will use unit-level information to derive the college-level budget in July and August annually, after the close out of the previous fiscal year is complete. However, federal capacity funds are reported and allocated according to the federal fiscal year, starting October 1<sup>st</sup> of each year. Thus, information on federal capacity funds will not be finalized in the college-level budget until October.

**6.2\. CANR teaching incentive**

**_~~To enhance enrollment and teaching activity and quality in the college, units with for-credit teaching activity are allocated funds based on unduplicated headcount enrollment and student credit hour (SCH) production within the unit.. The calculations and allocation amounts are shared with all appropriate unit leaders annually.~~_**

**6.3\. Federal capacity funds**

**_~~6.3.1\. Background and Guidelines: federal capacity funds in the Hatch, Smith-Lever, McIntire-Stennis and Animal Health programs~~_**

**_~~6.3.2\. Allocations of Federal Capacity Funds For Research, Research/Extension, And Integrated Projects~~_**

**_~~Federal capacity funds for research, extension, multi-state integrated projects are distributed annually to state agricultural experiment stations according to a formula that accounts for the agricultural activity of each respective state. These funds have a 1:1 state matching funds requirement. These programs are based on the following acts of Congress: the Hatch Act of 1887; the Smith-Lever Act of 1914; The McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act of 1962; and the Continuing Animal Health and Disease Research program within the Food and Agriculture act of 1977\. In each case the CANR Dean who is the Director of the UD Agricultural Experiment station is the lead PI responsible for the overall allocation of these funds to the respective units within the College.~~_**

**_~~Each capacity grant program has a different emphasis. Hatch funds can be broadly used to support, “…research on all aspects of agriculture, including soil and water conservation and use; plant and animal production, protection, and health; processing, distribution, safety, marketing, and utilization of food and agricultural products; forestry, including range management and range products; multiple use of forest rangelands, and urban forestry; aquaculture; home economics and family life; human nutrition; rural and community development; sustainable agriculture; molecular biology; and biotechnology. Research may be conducted on problems of local, State, regional, or national concern.” (Hatch 2015 RFA). One quarter of Hatch regular research funds are to be used to support multi-state projects. Once a faculty member joins a multi-state project, Hatch funds are allocated by the Department Chairs (with the approval of the Dean) to support travel and participation of the faculty member in the multistate project.~~_**

**_~~A portion of regular Hatch funds are allocated by the Dean to each department Chair according to the number of research FTE equivalents within their respective departments. In turn, each Chair uses these funds to support research activities within their department. Part of this departmental Hatch support is directly allocated to faculty PIs holding approved Hatch projects within the department. Faculty Hatch projects have duration of five years and are initiated through a written proposal from a faculty PI to their department chair. A portion of departmental Hatch support is also used to support the salaries of faculty members having research appointments.~~_**

**_~~In addition to allocating Hatch funds to department chairs, the CANR Dean allocates a portion of regular Hatch funds to the Assoc. Dean for Research and Graduate Programs. These funds are used to support a competitive CANR-wide seed grant program. The seed grant program is administered through an independent annual request for applications. A panel of faculty from the university reviews proposals and awards are administered through the Assoc. Dean’s office.~~_**

**_~~Smith-Lever funds are solely distributed to 1862 Land-Grant institutions to support cooperative extension programs within their respective states. The cooperative extension activities supported through Smith-Lever funding are broadly, “…to be used for the development of practical applications of research knowledge and giving of instruction and practical demonstrations of existing or improved practices or technologies in agriculture, uses of solar energy with respect to agriculture, home economics, and rural energy, and subjects relating thereto to persons not attending or resident in 1862 Land-Grant Institutions, and imparting information on those subjects through demonstrations, publications, and otherwise and for the necessary printing and distribution of information in connection with the subjects.” (Smith-Lever 2015 RFA). The Dean allocates annual Smith-Lever funds to the Dean of Extension who is subsequently responsible for distributing these funds among the varied cooperative extension activities of the College.~~_**

**_~~The McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Act, “…provides the basis for Federal funding in forestry research and graduate education programs at State-certified schools of forestry in the United States.~~_****_~~” (McIntire-Stennis (M-S) Cooperative Forestry Research Program – Capacity RFA, 2015). The definition of forestry research within the McIntire-Stennis act is broad and includes, “…management of forest and related rangeland for production of forage for domestic livestock and game and improvement of food and habitat for wildlife…” (McIntire-Stennis (M-S) Cooperative Forestry Research Program – Capacity RFA, 2015). In the spirit of this mission, the Dean allocates the Macintire-Stennis funds to the chair of ENWE. The chair of ENWE subsequently utilizes these funds to support faculty engaged in research related to wildlife ecology.~~_**

**_~~The Continuing Animal Health and Disease capacity grants program is designed, “…to assist all states in carrying out a program of research activities designed (1) to meet expenses of conducting animal health and disease research, publishing and disseminating the results of such research, … (2) for administrative planning and direction; and (3) to purchase equipment and supplies necessary for conducting such research.” (Continuing Animal Health and Disease, Food Security, and Stewardship Research, Education and Extension Program 2015 RFA).~~ _****_~~Given that the intent of these funds is to support research related to animal agriculture, the Dean allocates all annual Animal Health funds to the Chair of ANFS who subsequently utilizes these funds to support faculty engaged in animal agricultural research.~~_**
